          <a href="http://www.demandprogress.org/">Demand Progress/Demand Progress Action</a> takes your privacy very seriously. We do not share your email address or other personal information with unauthorized entities without your permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the information we collect to inform you of news that relates to Demand Progress, and to deliver petition signatures, emails/letters, and similar communications to designated targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For petitions, emails/letters, or similar public communications that you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street or email address address publicly available, but we may transmit it to public officials/petition targets as part of a petition or open letter. (For instance, this information must be included to enable delivery of emails to members of Congress.) Demand Progress may also use cookies from third parties such as Google Adwords to served ads based on usage of this site.
        </p>
        <p>
          DP (our 527 arm) and DPA (our 501(c)4 arm) have a resource sharing agreement that enables each to contact activists whose contact information was gathered by the other.  DP/DPA also owns and administers the WatchDog.net site.  And as of the summer of 2013, DP/DPA owns and administers Rootstrikers.org.  DP/DPA may contact subscribers to the Watchdog.net and Rootstrikers.org sublists.  You may unsubscribe from email alerts from any or all of DP/DPA, Rootstrikers.org, or Watchdog.net at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you enter your information as part of a clearly-labeled "joint action" with another organization, we may share your name, email, and other information you have entered with the partner organization(s) for that particular action.

          If you have any questions about our privacy policy, don’t hesitate to contact us.

          <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a> is committed to protecting your privacy. If you sign onto one of our various mailing lists, petitions, or use our contact tools, we retain the information you provided to primarily manage our mailing lists, and secondarily to transmit only the information that is required to service providers and public officials when required to submit your communications with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact information unless specifically stated so.

        <p>
          We may have joint campaigns with cooperating organizations and in those cases will explicitly state that we are doing so. In those cases, if your information will be shared with another organization in order to facilitate email delivery, list management, and other stated purposes, we will explicitly make notice on any campaign or website that this organization owns before you submit any of your information. If you are submitting your information to one of these campaigns or websites, you are opting into the sharing of your information for the stated purposes and will be treated as so. We will only share information which you submit at the time of notice and will not share any person's information obtained from other past or future campaigns, knowingly or on purpose.

          If there is a breach of this policy, it will only be done by error, accident, or involuntarily.
