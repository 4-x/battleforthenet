We are working on developer tools to allow you to join the Battle for the Net
with your site. If you use any of these, please reach out to Jeff Lyon
&lt;<a href="mailto:jeff@fightforthefuture.org">jeff@fightforthefuture.org</a>&gt;
so you can stay appraised of technical developments.

<h2>Modal/Banner Widget Code</h2>
<p>
    We are working on a widget that anyone can easily embed in their
    web site with just one line of Javascript code. This will be customizable to
    either
    show a modal action form or a banner. In both cases, some kind of
    "loading" animation will be displayed to the user.
</p>

<small><strong>A mockup of how the banner will look</strong></small>

<p>
    We've already done this on a past net neutrality action and our working to
    customize for September 9th.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://rubbingalcoholic.com/#ALWAYS_SHOW_SL_WIDGET"
            target="_blank">
            <strong>See demo of previous widget here.</strong>
        </a>
        <br/>
        Note: the final widget for our September net neutrality action will be
        <u>completely</u> different, this is just an example of what we are
        capable of. We will not block page loading for the final version.

            Github project for widget lives here.
        </a>
        <br/>
        The final version will be in the same project and have a different look
        and customization options, so check back soon for more updates!
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This project is open source so you will be to use ours or customize yours
    as needed. In either case we will be glad to assist with integration and
    customization.

<h2>Embeddable action form</h2>
<p>
    We also have an action form you can embed on your site. This is already
    working and used in Namecheap's
    <a href="http://www.netneutrality.com"
        target="_blank">netneutrality.com</a> action page.
